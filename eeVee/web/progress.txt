/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    for adding new groups into the create New event form you can just add children to any parent and their children and so.. on the table creation and insertion will be automatically taken care of 
        ONLY that you have to remember to name every new member you add properly
        
    for removing groups remember to remove the array() in the parent if you remove its child , then the create new event form is changed and insertion is made accordingly , the table is not removed but insertion is stopped. Therefore another table with the previously removed table's name is made then the table would already contain some events

Security{
        problem with MySQL DataBase
        encryption of path
		sql injection
		htmlspecial chars
		session variables may insert into another club table
        improve recovery model - if rcovery is on another system a idle setup should be made on it which in case the main system gets damaged then using recovery main database the ALL THE EVENTS PRESENT SHOULD BE PUSHED INTO BOTH CLUB DATABASES AND GROUP TABLES    
        same instant diffent posts paradox
        in login screen when the session variables are not null it directly redirects them to clubPortal ,so place a check in b/w
        what if the session variable names are tracked
