### Accurate 3D Bin Packing ###

* This is a java project that aims at optimizing the waste space due to packing of multiple parts in some fixed array of boxes
* Version - 1.1

### Use ###
* Execute the file FillMultipleBoxes.java
* To visualize the packing created by this algorithm, run the script plot.py using python3.
 

### NOTE ###
* Main function of FillMultipleBoxes.java runs the algorithm for a specific set of Boxes from Boxes.csv and random orders 100 times. Also, change the name of csv file read in ploy.py to choose packing you want to visualize.
