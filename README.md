# calender4j

## description
- A date and time library.
- Note the typo calend`e`r which was unintentional but is funny now, so I am keeping it.
- The main idea in this is to see the regular calendar as (uniform variant of calendar + noise due to months and lean years).
- It tries to consider all corner cases. It was tested, debugged and optimized a bit. 
- It has decent API and abstraction.
- Precision up to microseconds
- Range from 01/01/0001 00:00:00.0 to 31/12/2147483647 23:59:59.99999
- This was in part developed for `eevee{1,2}`.

## code
- Code is written in `java`.

## documentation
- The documentation of the code is itself.

## usage
- The intention was to use it as a library.
